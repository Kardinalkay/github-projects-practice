                      <p>I am a &#128557; disillusioned web developer to say the least, still focused on crafting great web experiences. 
                          It was a few years ago &ndash; four years precisely, when my passion for web design / development aroused.</p>                             
                      <p>One fateful day, I scrolled through my phone and found a tutorial book on XHTML 1.0 and I opened it and casually read it. I did not really understand much that day, <em>but my interest sparked.</em></p>
                      <p>Ever since, needless to say, I have taken the full leap into this profession: enjoying the art of creating beautifully designed, intuitive and functional websites, <strong>with an eye on accessibility.</strong></p>
                      <p>And as a side note, my favourite food is pounded yam with egusi soup, while my favourite colour is seashell.</p>

                      <p>A Martian actually, before descending and making a soft landing on one of the floodplains in Southern Nigeria eons ago. Now in Ontario and on a low profile, to pursue a career in web development. &#128520;</p>

                  <p>My favorite hobby is building things on the internet like ecommerce sites and email marketing campaigns but terrible at both, and I hope that will soon change &#128527;.</p>
